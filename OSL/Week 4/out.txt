# 1. Write a C program to create a child process. Display different messages in parent process and child process. Display PID and PPID of both parent and child process. Block parent process until child completes using wait system call.

OSL-4DS-A1@dsl-11:~/OSL/Week_4$ ./q1
child process
child PID: 450242 | child's parent PID: 450241

parent process
parent PID: 450241 | parent's parent PID: 443443


# 2. Write a C program to load the binary executable of the previous program in a child process using exec system call.

OSL-4DS-A1@dsl-11:~/OSL/Week_4$ ./q2
child process
child PID: 472087 | child's parent PID: 472086

parent process
parent PID: 472086 | parent's parent PID: 472085
loader parent. The child program has finished.

# 3. Create a zombie (defunct) child process (a child with exit() call, but no corresponding wait() in the sleeping parent) and allow the init process to adopt it (after parent terminates). Run the process as background process and run “ps”
command.
OSL-4DS-A1@dsl-11:~/OSL/Week_4$ ./q3
Parent (PID: 574380) sleeping for 20s. Check 'ps' now.
Child (PID: 574381) exiting...
Parent exiting. Child will be adopted by init.

# 4. Write a multithreaded program that performs different sorting algorithms. The program should work as follows: the user enters on the command line the number of elements to sort and the elements themselves. The program then creates
separate threads, each using a different sorting algorithm. Each thread sorts the array using its corresponding algorithm and displays the time taken to produce the result. The main thread waits for all threads to finish and then displays the final sorted array.

OSL-4DS-A1@dsl-11:~/OSL/Week_4$ gcc q4.c -o q4 -lpthread
OSL-4DS-A1@dsl-11:~/OSL/Week_4$ ./q4 5 50 10 40 20 30
Selection Sort took: 0.000275 seconds
Bubble Sort took: 0.000392 seconds
Final Sorted Array: 10 20 30 40 50 

# 5. Write multithreaded program that generates the Fibonacci series. The program should work as follows: The user will enter on the command line the number of Fibonacci numbers that the program is to generate. The program then will create
a separate thread that will generate the Fibonacci numbers, placing the sequence in data that is shared by the threads (an array is probably the most convenient data structure). When the thread finishes execution the parent will output the
sequence generated by the child thread. Because the parent thread cannot begin outputting the Fibonacci sequence until the child thread finishes, this will require having the parent thread wait for the child thread to finish.

OSL-4DS-A1@dsl-11:~/OSL/Week_4$ ./q5 7
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
